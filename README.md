# Hello, my name is Frank 


I grew up in northern Virginia and currently reside in central Pennsylvania. I competed springboard in college and fell in love with print making at some point. My early interest in philosophy lead me down the rabbit hole of maths-- particularly, statistics.

## Civic systems
I work as a data and systems consultant providing enterprise digital modernization and transformation to federal clients at the Kastling Group. I've been lucky to work with the Office of the Clerk and of the House Legislative Counsel within the U.S. House of Representatives, and Democracy Fund in coordination with GovTrack.

## Political analysis
Previously, I worked as an operations and analytics director at a state caucus, and manager for some state-office races. I got to lead mid-scale campaign teams and learn about map making, targeting, and prediction during my time at the caucus.
