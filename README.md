# Hello, my name is Frank 


I grew up in northern Virginia and currently reside in central Pennsylvania. I competed springboard in college and fell in love with print making at some point. My early interest in philosophy lead me down the rabbit hole of maths-- particularly, statistics.

## Civic systems
I work as a data and systems consultant providing enterprise digital modernization and transformation to federal clients at the [Kastling Group](https://kastling.com/). I've been lucky to work with the [Office of the Clerk](https://clerk.house.gov/) and of the [House Legislative Counsel](https://legcounsel.house.gov/) within the [U.S. House of Representatives](), and [Democracy Fund](https://democracyfund.org/) in coordination with [GovTrack](https://www.govtrack.us/).

## Political analysis
Previously, I worked as an operations and analytics director at a state caucus, and manager for some state-office races. I got to lead mid-scale campaign teams and learn about [map making](https://github.com/fburdell/maps), [targeting](https://github.com/fburdell/franklinbot/tree/master/targeting), and [prediction](https://github.com/fburdell/score_voter) during my time at the caucus.
